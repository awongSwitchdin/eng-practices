# SwitchDin Engineering Practices Documentation

SwitchDin is developing engineering practices that cover the languages used.
These documents represent our collective experience of various
best practices that we have learned over time.

These documents were forked from [Google's code review
process and policy documents](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/).

Currently this contains the following documents:

*   [SwitchDin's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two
    separate sets of documents:
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)

## Terminology

There is some SwitchDin-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here for external readers:

*   **CL**: Stands for "changelist", which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change", "patch", or "pull-request".
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a CL.
